# Cub3D: My First RayCaster with MinilibX

## Project Description
Cub3D is a programming project inspired by the game Wolfenstein 3D, the first FPS in video game history, developed by ID Software. The main objective of this project is to create a dynamic 3D view inside a maze using the ray-casting technique. This project helps familiarize with the basics of C programming, algorithms, and graphic design using the MinilibX library.

## Objectives
- Develop an application in C following coding standards.
- Use ray-casting algorithms to create a 3D representation.
- Manage graphic display with MinilibX, including textures and colors for walls, floor, and ceiling.
- Implement keyboard interactions to move the camera and interact with the application.

## Prerequisites
- Operating system compatible with MinilibX (Linux, macOS).
- C compiler (gcc).
- MinilibX library.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Arnaud212/Cub3D.git
   cd Cub3D
   ```

2. **Compile the project**:
   ```sh
   make
   ```

## Usage
To run the project, use the following command :
```sh
./Cub3D map.cub
```

## Keyboard Commands

- **Left/Right Arrows**: Rotate the camera
- **W, A, S, D**: Move the camera
- **ESC**: Quit the application
- **Red Cross on the window**: Close the application
